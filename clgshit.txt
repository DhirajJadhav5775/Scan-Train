So here’s the brutally honest truth.
I’m 22. I did B.Tech in Electronics (not Computer Science). College was a disaster — barely passed, hated what I studied, and didn’t learn anything useful. No real skills, no job, no direction.

But I’ve realized I love tech. I want to become a software developer. I want to go from absolute zero to job-ready in the next 12 months. I don’t have time to do another degree, but I do have time to grind every day if I have a plan.

I know basic Python and I’m comfortable Googling my way through stuff. But beyond that, I’m lost.

Can someone help me figure this out?

What exact skills/languages should I learn?

Which roadmap actually leads to a real job?

How do I practice and build projects that employers care about?

No fluff. Just need something practical. If you were in my shoes — what would YOU do?
